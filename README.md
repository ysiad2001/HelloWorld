The repository I was interested in is the QQ Group Repeater by BoyanZh at <https://github.com/BoYanZh/QQGroupRepeater> The QQ bot made use of QQ chatting groups, can read the chat text and make responses. The project can potentially be modified to become a search engine on QQ, a judge for online quizzes, and so on.
